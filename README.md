# The Sopranos: Who Killed Who?

This little game was the product of a one-day hackathon-style mini project. Designed as a task for us to practice a bit of Ruby, it features a Rails API and an Angular front-end.

As Sopranos fans, my partner and I pair-programmed this short 5-question quiz to test people's knowledge of some of the TV show's famous murders. Once an answer is given, the user can watch a clip of the whacking. It was a lot of fun to make and nice to get more familiar with a different back-end language as our course is mostly Javascript-focused.
